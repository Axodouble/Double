# XDBLArena, portable easy to use arenas.
### Overly branded as xdbl.dev, I know.

This is a project that I initially commissioned and since then have edited substantially to allow a lot of different things.

Current features include:
- ELO Scores for PVP Matches.
- Community Market.
- Totemless & Totems enabled PVP.
- Player created arenas.
- Moderation system to ban certain players from making arenas or to pvp.
- Easy to use setup and easily manageable permissions.
